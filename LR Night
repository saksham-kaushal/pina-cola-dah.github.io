# Overwhelming Labour Room Night
## Last day of the OBG posting (amidst lockdown)

At around 1:00 a.m. a patient came to the labour room at period of gestation = 37+ weeks. She was received by a 2nd year pg doctor. Being an intern, I did not know much about the case that time but I was told to draw the blood sample. So I applied a Canulla to her left arm and scolded her for not cooperating. But when I looked at her face she was glowing with the sweat on her face and was keeping her eyes closed. Clearly she was in pain. I did not speak much to her because of her poor condition. 

After some time I was asked to take her blood pressure, which I took on the right arm. I used Digital sphygnomanometer (Dr. Morepen) and also side by side checked the B.P. manually also. It came out to be systolic in 60s and diastolic in 50s, which is hypotensive. I only took one reading and did not check again because manually also systolic was definitely below 100 mm of Hg.

Next I remember was that she was rushed 500ml of Normal Saline solution by the co-intern in order to get her B.P. back to normal.

At around 4 p.m. I was told to do the foetal heart monitoring of all the patients. That patient was the last one to be monitored by me for the foetal heart and it took me 2-3 minutes to localise the heart rate of the foetus. There was something unusual about her abdomen was that there were bluish marks there, which I thought would be engorged veins because of pregnancy. I was not able to localise the foetal heart and informed the same to the 2nd year pg, when she told me that she had a **INTRAUTERINE DEAD FOETUS** for God knows how long. After that I resumed my work.

Then at 7:15 a.m. she was given a Labetalol i.v. which is given when a patient has hypertensive urgency. I asked the co-intern if there was anything wrong with her. He told me that her B.P. rose to systolic 213mm of Hg. Her feet were swollen which I noticed myself.


I was shocked.
She came to us in a Hypotensive state, and now she has a high B.P.?
How is that possible?


Then around 7:30 I went to see the patient and saw that a pg was holding her head to one side, as she was aspirating the food content from her mouth and nose. The patient was throwing a seizure and it was tonic I think as there were no jerky movements at all. It was scary for me because I haven't seen peope throwing fits live. In just 1 minute in front of me the pg started giving  CPR to the patient. I was so confused that if it was a seizure, this is not how we manage it. CPR is given when there are no vital signs seen in a patient. 


All of a sudden it struck me in seconds that did I take the wrong B.P.?
Or we shouldn't have rushed the NS?
Was Ringer Lactate the better solution to be given?
She came to us in a painful condition just like other women, how could have I differentiated between the pain she was having and the pain other females were having, so that I could pay more attention towards her?



The **BIG** abdomen was moving with the CPR. I mean just imagine for a second a CPR given to a 9 months pregnant female.



The mind was totally numb, and I ran to call the anaesthesia people to give the CPR even after knowing that co-intern has gone. By the time I came back after intimating the anaesthesiologist, 3rd year pg had also come who was now giving the CPR. Adrenaline 1 ampule was given by that time. 2nd round of CPR was given by anaesthiologist, with second dose of Adrenaline. Carotid was there which is a sign of hope. 3rd round was initiated but it was all in vain. The patient had collapsed.

I am running short of words to depict the scene but it was frightening. Never in my Final year and Internship till that day had I seen a death in the Labour Room. Other patients were present there too spectating everything. I can't imagine how devastating it must have been for them. 


Witnessing mortality is a part of my field, but I always keep very high hopes from CPR and that's what I had for this patient too.


2nd year pg told us that we should have investigated her for *Dissaminated Intravascular Coagulopathy* by sending D-dimer test as it was IUD. 


But here I am still interrogating myself that why had I not paid attention to her?
Did I take the B.P. wrong?
